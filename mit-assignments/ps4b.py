'''Write a function, called nestEggVariable, which takes three arguments: a salary
(salary), a percentage of your salary to save (save), and a list of annual growth
percentages on investments (growthRates). The length of the last argument defines the
number of years you plan to work; growthRates[0] is the growth rate of the first year,
growthRates[1] is the growth rate of the second year, etc. (Note that because the
retirement fundâ€™s initial value is 0, growthRates[0] is, in fact, irrelevant.) This function
should return a list, whose values are the size of your retirement account at the end of
each year.
